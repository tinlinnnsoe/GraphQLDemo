What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. The GraphQL specification was open-sourced in 2015 and has since been implemented in a variety of programming languages. GraphQL isn’t tied to any specific database or storage engine—it is backed by your existing code and data. 


GraphQL becomes critical when:

1. Highly Dynamic and Complex Client Needs
   
Scenario: Multiple clients (e.g., web, mobile, IoT devices) require different subsets of data from your API.


Why GraphQL is Needed:

•	Clients request only the fields they need, minimizing payload sizes.

•	A single API endpoint simplifies client-side logic.

Example: E-commerce Platform: A mobile app might need product names and prices, while the desktop site also needs descriptions, reviews, and stock status.


2. Real-Time Applications
   
Scenario: Applications requiring real-time updates (e.g., chat apps, live dashboards, or collaborative tools).

•	Subscriptions enable live updates efficiently.

3. Aggregating Data from Multiple Sources
4. 
Scenario: Applications relying on data spread across different services (e.g., microservices or external APIs).
Why GraphQL is Needed:

•	A single GraphQL query fetches data from multiple sources and unifies it in a single response.
